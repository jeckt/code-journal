Personal Coding Journal
=======================

This is a my personal coding journal which provides
useful information on various proramming topics that 
I have discovered along my journey through programming.

The purpose of this journal is to provide a quick reference
to useful notes, cheat sheets and tips for effective
programming.

It will also include a simple section providing an
overview of areas I would like to devote time to
learn/develop.
